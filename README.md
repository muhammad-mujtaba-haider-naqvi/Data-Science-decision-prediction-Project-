# Data-Science-decision-prediction-Project-
End-to-end Data Science project on a Bike Buying dataset, implementing the complete preprocessing, data cleaning, transformation, reduction, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) pipeline to extract insights and prepare data for purchase prediction.

# 🚲 Bike Buying Prediction Model  
## Data Science Lifecycle & Exploratory Data Analysis Project

---

## Project Overview
This project presents an end-to-end **Data Science and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) pipeline** applied to a real-world **Bike Buying dataset** sourced from an open-source platform. The primary objective is to analyze customer demographic and behavioral attributes to understand purchasing patterns and support **bike purchase prediction**.

The project strictly follows the **complete Data Science Lifecycle**, with a strong emphasis on **data preprocessing, data quality handling, transformation, reduction, and exploratory analysis**.

---

## Dataset Description
- **Source:** Open-source dataset (e.g., Kaggle / UCI Repository)  
- **Type:** Structured, mixed data (Numerical + Categorical)  
- **Purpose:**  
  To analyze factors influencing bike purchase decisions such as income, age, commute distance, education, marital status, and region, and to prepare the dataset for predictive modeling.

---

## Project Objectives
- Apply all stages of the **Data Science Lifecycle**
- Identify and resolve **real-world data quality issues**
- Perform **descriptive, visual, and statistical EDA**
- Justify the selection or rejection of preprocessing and analytical techniques
- Extract meaningful insights for **bike purchase prediction**

## Data Preprocessing Pipeline

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning

#### Handling Missing Data
- Row deletion (with and without threshold)
- Column deletion (with and without threshold)
- Simple imputation (Mean, Median, Mode)
- Propagation methods (Forward Fill, Backward Fill)
- Advanced imputation using **KNN Imputer**

#### Handling Noisy Data
- Binning (data smoothing)
- Regression-based smoothing
- Clustering-based smoothing
- Outlier detection:
  - Interquartile Range (IQR)
  - Z-Score method

#### Handling Inconsistent Data
- Standardizing categorical text values
- Fixing typos and inconsistent labels
- Data normalization

#### Handling Duplicate Data
- Detecting duplicate records
- Dropping duplicates
- Keeping first or last occurrence where appropriate

>  *Each technique is followed by an interpretation and reasoning section.*

### 2️⃣ Data Integration
The following integration issues are identified and resolved:
- Schema / structural mismatch
- Data format inconsistency
- Data redundancy and duplication
- Value conflicts
- Missing or incomplete attributes
- Scale and unit differences
- Key / identifier mismatch
- Semantic conflicts (meaning differences)

---

### 3️⃣ Data Reduction
To reduce dimensionality and data size, the following techniques are applied:
- Attribute subset selection (Feature Selection)
- Parametric method: Regression models
- Non-parametric method: Histogram analysis
- Clustering using **K-Means**
- Aggregation to summarize data groups

---

### 4️⃣ Data Transformation
At least three of the following transformation techniques are applied:
- Normalization (Min-Max, Z-Score)
- Feature construction
- Discretization
- Logarithmic transformation
- Power transformation
- Smoothing and aggregation

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 🔹 Descriptive EDA
- **Measures of Central Tendency:** Mean, Median, Mode
- **Measures of Variability:** Range, Variance, Standard Deviation, MAD, IQR
- **Position Measures:** Quartiles, Percentiles
- **Shape Analysis:** Skewness, Kurtosis

### 🔹 Visual EDA
- Univariate analysis
- Bivariate analysis
- Multivariate analysis

 **More than five visualizations** are included covering univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses.

---

## Analytical Reasoning & Justification
- Every preprocessing and analytical technique is **clearly justified**
- Techniques that are not suitable for the dataset are:
  - Properly explained
  - Demonstrated using subsets, simulated, or transformed data when possible
- Emphasis is placed on **analysis, experimentation, and reasoning**, not just correct outputs
